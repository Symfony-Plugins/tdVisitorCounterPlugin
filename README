tdVisitorCounterPlugin
======================

Provides funcionalities for easy visitor counting feature, including schema,
libs, interface and a flash panel to display latest visiting stats.

This plugin is a part of __TD CMS__ and is based on __Doctrine ORM__.

Installation
============

Install the plugin via the subversion repository by executing the following
command from the project root directory:

    $ svn co http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/tdVisitorCounterPlugin/trunk plugins/tdVisitorCounterPlugin

or by using the default symfony plugin install command:

    $ ./symfony plugin:install -s beta tdVisitorCounterPlugin

as the actual release is in its beta stage.

Usage
=====

  * Re-run building your model (td_counter table holds data about users visits).

  * If you wish, you may generate some fixture data for the visitors counter
    (using _data/fixtures/fixtures.yml_ file).

  * enable the tdVisitorCounter module in your backend application, so that you
    may use the statitics about user visits using open flash chart.

  * make sure the config/routing.yml file is uncommented (otherwise you will
    have to create your own routing entries forwarding to _index_ action of
    _tdVisitorCounter_ module).

  * append the following code inside your main frontend application template
    (e. g. layout.php):

        [php]
        tdVisitorManager::markVisitor();

    which adds a single visitor entry to the database. This mechanisms relies on
    browser cookies - if the _visited_ cookie doesn't exist, such a cookie is
    created (existing 3 minutes by default) and an entry to the td_counter table
    is added.

Configuration
=============

You can modify settings of the tdVisitorCounterPlugin in the
__config/tdVisitorCounterPluginConfiguration.class.php__ file:

  * _td_visitor_counter_cookie_ - name of the cookie used for visitors counting.

  * _td_visitor_counter_months_ - number of last months shown on the chart.

  * _td_visitor_counter_days_ - number of last days shown on the chart.

  * _td_visitor_counter_cookie_interval_ - expire time of a visitor cookie.
